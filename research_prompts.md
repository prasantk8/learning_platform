**Research Prompts:**

***Prompt for Module 1: The Narrative Engine***
**Act as an expert EdTech strategist and narrative designer.** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the global market for "interactive, branch-based story-driven learning" platforms, specifically targeting Gen Z and young adults (ages 13-25). 

Your goal is to identify the blueprint for a category-defining product. Please analyze:

1.  **Market Gaps & Differentiation:** Critically evaluate existing platforms (e.g., Choices: Stories You Play, visual novels, Khan Academy's story-based exercises). What are their key weaknesses in promoting **ethical reasoning, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence**? How do they fail to create a seamless "learn-by-doing" loop?
2.  **Innovative Feature Set:** Based on current trends in generative AI, interactive media, and pedagogy, propose a detailed and innovative feature list. Categorize them into:
    *   **MVP (Phase 1):** Core, differentiating features to build first (e.g., "Emotional Choice Tagging" system for AI analysis).
    *   **Iteration 2:** Features to deepen engagement (e.g., "Dynamic Story State" that changes based on quest performance).
    *   **Future Vision:** Blue-sky features (e.g., "AI Co-Pilot for User-Generated Stories").
3.  **Content Architecture:** Propose a list of 5 "Macro" narrative themes (e.g., "The Ethical Technologist," "The Community Architect"). For each theme, suggest 3 "Micro" or "Nano" course concepts (e.g., a nano-course: "Navigating AI Bias: A Day in the Life of a Hiring Manager").
4.  **Monetization & Production Models:** Research and suggest efficient models for producing high-quality branching narratives (e.g., partnering with indie game writers, using AI voice synthesis, UGC marketplace).

Provide a structured report with clear recommendations for a phased product rollout.


***Prompt for Module 2: The Quest Arena***

**Act as an expert in learning science and gamification.** Analyze the current landscape of adaptive, gamified learning platforms and skill-assessment tools (e.g., Duolingo, Kahoot, Brilliant, Codecademy) for a target audience of Gen Z.

Your goal is to design the most effective "challenge" system that moves beyond rote memorization. Please provide:

1.  **Gap Analysis:** What is the primary criticism of current gamified learning apps concerning the development of **higher-order thinking skills** (analysis, evaluation, creation) and **soft skills** (e.g., empathy, collaboration)? Focus on the lack of context and real-world application.
2.  **Next-Gen Assessment Features:** Propose a detailed list of innovative challenge formats that could assess skills like creativity, systems thinking, and ethical decision-making. Categorize them into:
    *   **MVP (Phase 1):** Essential, scalable formats (e.g., "Context-Rich Multi-Variable MCQs").
    *   **Iteration 2:** Advanced formats (e.g., "Simulation-Based Sandbox Challenges" where learners balance trade-offs).
    *   **Future Vision:** (e.g., "AI-Driven, Real-Time Debate and Negotiation Simulations").
3.  **Adaptive Algorithm Strategy:** Research and recommend strategies for a dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm that uses a continuous feedback loop from narrative choices *and* quest performance. How can it prevent frustration and boredom effectively?
4.  **Phased Skill Taxonomy:** Suggest a taxonomy of "Future-Ready Skills" (e.g., "Prompt Engineering," "Algorithmic Bias Detection") to be assessed. Propose which 5 skills are most critical for the MVP and how to measure them.

Provide a structured report with a clear, phased technical and content roadmap.



***Prompt for Module 3: The Creation Studio***

**Act as an expert in project-based learning (PBL) and portfolio development.** Research modern "digital portfolio builders" and "project-based learning platforms" (e.g., Riipen, Pathrise, Arcadia, Maven) for students and young professionals.

Your goal is to design a seamless "learn-to-portfolio" pipeline. Please analyze:

1.  **Market Gap:** Identify the key shortcomings of existing platforms. Why do they often feel like an "add-on" rather than an integrated part of learning? Focus on lack of curation, weak mentor integration, and disconnectedness from learning content.
2.  **Integrated Feature Set:** Propose a comprehensive list of features for a studio that is **triggered by** a learner's narrative journey and skill gaps. Categorize into:
    *   **MVP (Phase 1):** (e.g., "AI-Generated Project Briefs" based on the user's last story chapter, "Basic Portfolio Website Generator").
    *   **Iteration 2:** (e.g., "Integrated Peer Collaboration Workspace," "Sandbox API integrations with Replit/Figma").
    *   **Future Vision:** (e.g., "AI Project Mentor" for initial feedback, "Micro-Internship Marketplace" with real companies).
3.  **Project Taxonomy:** Generate a list of 10+ specific, innovative project ideas tailored for Gen Z, categorized by theme (e.g., **Tech & AI:** "Design an ethical AI chatbot for mental health first aid"; **Sustainability:** "Create a business plan for an upcycled fashion pop-up"). Ensure they are portfolio-worthy.
4.  **Phased Rollout Plan:** Recommend which project types and tool integrations are simplest to implement for the MVP to demonstrate maximum value quickly.

***Prompt for Module 4: The Mentorship Core (AI & Human)***



**Act as an expert in AI-enabled education and community building.** Conduct a deep analysis of "AI mentor" chatbots (e.g., Khanmigo, Quizlet's Q-Chat) and online mentorship platforms (e.g., MentorCruise, ADPList) for young learners.

Your goal is to design a hybrid "human-in-the-loop" mentorship system that is scalable yet deeply personal. Please provide:

1.  **Critical Evaluation:** Identify the failures of current AI mentors (e.g., shallow responses, lack of context) and the limitations of human-only platforms (e.g., lack of scalability, high cost). How can a hybrid model solve these?
2.  **Socratic AI Mentor Features:** Define the specific capabilities a "Socratic AI Mentor" must have for our platform (e.g., "Context-Awareness of the learner's current story and project," "Ability to ask probing questions instead of giving answers"). Propose a phased feature rollout for this AI.
3.  **Intergenerational Matching Algorithm:** Research and propose a framework for an algorithm that matches young learners with older adult mentors not just based on skills, but on **complementary personality traits, values, and learning goals.** What data points are needed?
4.  **Structured Mentorship Programs:** Suggest a list of 5-7 structured "Mentorship Streams" or programs (e.g., "The Ethical Tech Sprint," "The Creative Freelancer Path") that combine AI-guided learning with scheduled human mentor sessions. Outline the curriculum for one.

***Prompt for Module 5: The Community Hub***

**Act as an expert in online community design and social learning.** Analyze the biggest "online learning communities" and "local meetup platforms" (e.g., StudyTogether, Meetup, Circle.so, Discord learning servers) to understand what drives engagement and combats loneliness.

Your goal is to design a platform that seamlessly blends global reach with local, real-world impact. Please analyze:

1.  **Engagement Gap Analysis:** Why do many online learning communities fail? Why do online course platforms have low completion rates? Focus on lack of accountability, weak social bonds, and no "real-world" anchor.
2.  **Blended Model Features:** Propose a detailed list of features for an "Online-to-Offline (O2O)" community platform. Categorize into:
    *   **MVP (Phase 1):** (e.g., "AI-Powered Pod Matchmaking," "Virtual Study Rooms," "Tools for organizing local guild meetups").
    *   **Iteration 2:** (e.g., "Guild Health Dashboard," "Collaborative Project Tools for pods," "Integration with local event spaces").
    *   **Future Vision:** (e.g., "Global-Local Impact Leaderboards," "API for schools/co-working spaces to host guilds").
3.  **Pod & Guild Structure:** Define the optimal structure for online "Pods" (small, private groups) and local "Guilds" (larger, city-based chapters). What activities should they be incentivized to do?
4.  **Phased Growth Strategy:** Recommend a rollout strategy, starting with a few key cities/university towns to create dense, active guilds that can serve as case studies for global expansion.
