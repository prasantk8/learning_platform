# Project Udaan - MVP "Concept Weaver" - Learnings & Final Specification

## 1. Executive Summary
Based on direct testing with our primary user (Grade 11 student), we validated that **math anxiety** and **abstractness** are the primary barriers to learning physics/chemistry concepts.  

Our MVP approach of using **relatable analogies + real-world connections + scaffolded problem-solving** demonstrated significant reduction in anxiety and improved conceptual understanding.  

This document formalizes our learnings and the technical specification for the scaled MVP.

## 2. Validated User Pain Points

### 2.1 Core Problems Identified
- **Fear of Mathematical Symbols:** Equations and dimensional formulas trigger immediate anxiety  
- **Abstractness Barrier:** Inability to connect formulas (F=ma, mole calculations) to tangible reality  
- **Numerical Phobia:** Mental block when encountering word problems requiring multi-step solutions  
- **Lack of Relevance:** No connection between syllabus topics and real-world applications  

### 2.2 Specific Problem Topics
- **Physics:** Dimensional Analysis, Laws of Motion, Gravitation  
- **Chemistry:** Mole Concept, Equilibrium, Atomic Structure wavelength problems

## 3. MVP Validation Results

### 3.1 What Worked Exceptionally Well
**Analogy-First Approach:**
- "Chemist's dozen" for mole concept → Immediate understanding  
- "Universal language" for dimensional analysis → Reduced abstraction  
- "SpaceX rocket equations" for real-world connection → Generated excitement  

**Step Scaffolding:**
- Breaking numericals into 4–5 micro-steps with guidance at each stage  
- Asking Socratic questions before providing answers  
- Celebrating completion of each step to build confidence  

**Real-World Connections:**
- Linking gravitation to satellite technology and GPS  
- Connecting mole concept to pharmaceutical manufacturing  
- Relating dimensional analysis to engineering safety checks  

### 3.2 What Needs Improvement
- **Visual Representation:** Users needed whiteboard-like visualizations  
- **Multilingual Support:** Occasional Hindi explanations significantly improved understanding  
- **Progress Tracking:** Users wanted to see their improvement over time  
- **Error Recovery:** Better handling of wrong answers without causing frustration

## 4. Technical Architecture (Revised)

### 4.1 Model Selection
- **Primary Choice:** Mistral 7B (Apache 2.0 License, strong reasoning capabilities)  
- **Fallback Option:** Llama 3 8B (when released, pending license review)  
- **Fine-tuning Method:** QLoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation  

### 4.2 Core System Prompts (Validated)
**Socratic Tutor Prompt:**

Act as Udaan, a compassionate physics/chemistry tutor for Indian students. Follow this structure:
- **EMPATHIZE:** Acknowledge the topic can be challenging
- **ANALOGIZE:** Explain using a daily life analogy (e.g., dozen for moles)
- **CONNECT:** Mention real-world application (SpaceX, pharmaceuticals, etc.)
- **SOLVE:** Break problems into micro-steps with guiding questions
- **ENCOURAGE:** Use supportive language and occasional Hindi phrases
  Never give direct answers. Always explain the 'why'.


### 4.3 Data Requirements
- Curated dataset of **500+ prompt-response pairs**  
- Each pair includes: topic, analogy, real-world connection, scaffolded solution  
- **Bilingual support (English + Hindi explanations)**  
- Common error cases and recovery strategies
